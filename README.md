# StockMeter

Measure and notify stock prices.

## About

This is a [Flutter](https://flutter.dev/) project for learning purposes. The developed application offers a monitoring
tool about Stock Exchanges, Mutual Funds, Indexes and other financial data available in Google products. From this data,
_trading simulations_ and _customizable notifications_ based on price values are featured.

## Privacy Policy

StockMeter uses [Google Sheets](https://www.google.com/sheets/about/) to store and calculate the financial data. Because
of this, it is required a [Google Account](https://www.google.com/account/about/) and granted access to Google Drive. In
any case, the application stores personal data or access other files beyond the strictly Google Sheets files required to
work.

## Terms of Service

The data is provided by [Google Finance](https://www.google.com/finance/) and may be delayed by up to 20 minutes. Read
its [disclaimer](https://www.google.com/googlefinance/disclaimer/#!#disclaimers) for more details. In addition to this
delay, the _notification_ feature may add an extra time depending on the periodical check configured. For these
reasons, **this application is for informational purposes, not for trading purposes or advice**.
