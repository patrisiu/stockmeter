# StockMeter

Track Stocks, Mutual Funds & Indexes with private price alerts synced to your Google Drive.

## About

**StockMeter** is a Flutter project developed for educational and research purposes. It serves as a personal monitoring tool for tracking **Stock Exchanges, Mutual Funds, and Global Market Indexes** using the Google Finance ecosystem.

The project explores the integration of mobile applications with private cloud backends to feature:
* **Live Market Observation:** Real-time tracking of equities and fund NAVs.
* **Customizable Notifications:** Threshold-based alerts for price movements.
* **Trading Simulations:** A sandbox environment to test strategies using historical and current data.

StockMeter is built with a **Zero-Knowledge Architecture**, ensuring that your financial intelligence remains entirely under your control.

## Privacy Policy (Data Sovereignty)

To ensure maximum privacy, StockMeter utilizes your personal **Google Drive** as its primary database rather than a third-party server.
* **Private Storage:** All portfolio data and calculations are stored in **Google Sheets** within your own account.
* **Scoped Permissions:** A Google Account is required. StockMeter requests permission to access *only* the specific files it creates.
* **No Tracking:** The application does not collect personal data, nor does it access any files beyond the strictly required Google Sheets. Your strategy is invisible to everyone—including the developers.
